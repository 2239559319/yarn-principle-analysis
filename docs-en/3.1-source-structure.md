This chapter begins to formally enter the source code learning.

## Source code structure

The source code files are all located in the `src` directory. The following are the file contents in the src directory.

The functions of the files or folders are as follows:

1. cli

    The cli folder is the main folder for running commands, and the `commands` folder contains the specific code for each command execution. These commands are exported by `commands/index.js`, and each command will export a `run` function, which is the entry function for each command to execute the specific content of the command. For example, the implementation of the `list` command of `yarn list` is in the `run` function in `commands/list.js`.

    What is exported from `commands/index.js` is an object, `key` is the command name, `value` is the object, and this object has properties such as `run`. The `run` property here refers to the function executed when running the command. There are some properties such as `setFlags` which will be discussed later when we talk about the `main` function.

2. fetchers

    This folder is the function of `yarn` to obtain the package source, mainly `tarball-fetcher` and `git-fetcher`, etc. This will be explained in detail later.

3. lockfile

    Operations related to the `yarn.lock` file.

4. registries

    Code related to the npm source. This will be discussed in detail later.

5. reporters

    Code related to the input and output of `yarn`. The most important ones are `ConsoleResporter` and `JsonResporter`. `ConsoleResporter` outputs to standard output, and `JsonResporter` outputs to a json file.

6. resolvers

    Code related to npm and yarn configuration.

7. util

    Tool folder, the implementation inside is very low-level.

The remaining files are displayed in a table.

|File name|Function|
|-----|----|
|api.js|This is an empty file|
|config.js|This file is related to the internal settings of yarn|
|constants.js|This is a file for constants|
|error.js|Related to errors|
|hoisted-tree-builder.js|Related to the yarn audit command, used to generate the tree structure required for audit|
|integrity-checker.js|Used to detect the integrity of the file, the yarn.lock file has the integrity attribute|
|package-compatibility.js|Compatibility detection, detect the Cpu, Platform, and Engines fields in package.json|
|package-constraint-resolver.js|Used to obtain the specific version number|
|package-fetcher.js|Related to fetchers|
|package-hoister.js|Related to the yarn audit tree|
|package-install-scripts.js|Code related to running yarn script|
|package-linker.js|Related to link-related files, yarn's link does not only refer to yarn link command, but is related to copying the final file to the target path|
|package-reference.js|Abstract package code|
|package-request.js|Related to the request of the package tarball file|
|package-resolver.js|Related to resolvers|
|rc.js|Yarn's own configuration file yarn.rc file related code|
|resolution-map.js|Related to resolution|
|types.js|Flow type|
|workspace-layout|Related to workspace|

## Overall overview of the running

Here is the overall operation flow chart.

![overview of the running](https://unpkg.com/xiaochuan-static-dev@0.0.13/dist/cd78f24cfd27191e.png)

The overall process is to enter the main function and initialize several global configuration items, then find the command from the commands object and take out the `run` function to run it.

View and debug the `src/cli/index.js` code, which is an entry file for running `yarn`. The file mainly contains the `start` function and the `main` function.

### start function

The content of the start function is very short, here is the pseudo code.

```js
if (exit(.yarnrc) && .yarnrc[yarnpath]) {  // If the .yarnrc file exists and yarnpath is configured in the file
    spawn(yarnpath);   // Open a new child process to execute the yarn in the corresponding yarn path
} else {
    main();
}
```

The start function provides a way to execute the `yarn` distribution in any path.

### main function

The main function mainly initializes several configuration items and finds the corresponding `run` function of `command` to run.

The following things were done.

- Initialize `commander`, which is a tool for reading command lines and setting parameters, etc. The open source [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) is used. In addition to setting global parameters, different `command` parameters are set according to different `command`s. This is achieved based on the `setFlags` function exported in each command file.

- Initialize `reporter`. By default, `ConsoleReporter` will output yarn's output to standard output. If `--json` is added when running `yarn`, `JsonReporter` will be used and the output will be output to a `json` file.

- Initialize `Config`. `Config` of `yarn` is more complicated and will be discussed later.

- Take out the `run` function of `command` from `commands` and execute it. Here we enter the specific implementation of the command. The calling parameters of the `run` function are shown in the figure below.

    ```js
    command.run(config, reporter, commander, commander.args)
    ```

Below is the call stack and its variables when calling command.run.

## Summarize

This chapter explains the basic directory structure of the `yarn` source code and the basic process of `yarn` operation. Many new things such as `Config` and `Resolver` are left out in this chapter and will be explained in detail in the following articles.
